## How can I use it?

> Don't forget to backup your existing mark.dat

No downloads required, just go to https://dangarfield.github.io/ff7-mark-dat-editor

Edit the colours, click save and replace you `mark.dat` file. It's normally located in the `data/battle` folder.

## Just colours? Can't I edit anything else

Yes, in time, but I haven't looked at the rest of file for positional information at this point. I will do and this tool will be updated
