## How can I use it?

> Don't forget to backup your existing mark.dat

No downloads required, just go to https://dangarfield.github.io/ff7-mark-dat-editor

Edit the colours and positions, click save and replace you `mark.dat` file. It's normally located in the `data/battle` folder.

## TODO

There may be a way to add more vertices to this, but I no real ambition or desire to do so at this juncture. If you really want it, feel free to raise a request
